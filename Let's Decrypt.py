    Reading desc and the number of points, this song is definitely more difficult than the article Let's Decrypt. I need to know when the server released the flag, actually finished reading I do not know where it released the flag. :penguin:
    Back to the post, this chall resembles chall first Let's Decrypt, also ask me to send the numbers n and and e, tell s (signature), so that m = pow(s, e, n). It's here. m In fact, it is 3 paragraphs, corresponding to the following:

index = 0 --> This is a test for a fake signature.
index = 1 --> My name is Zupp and I own CryptoHack.org
index = 2 --> Please send all my money to 88830112005MBBank

    So I need to find a way to find it again. e and and n corresponding satisfaction. Besides know flag have been xor with other secret paragraphs so I will send 3 paragraphs in turn m Up and xor to find. flag.
    Source of attack algorithm reference in Here it isIn fact, the problem will be about to find e is the dlog of m In school mod n.
    First, I will generate two numbers. p and and q, but actually only need to start once and the hat up several times (n = p^k) so that p It's smooth prime. Notes p It has to be some elements, so I will choose. p = 2010103 It is also due to the failure of multiple tests. :penguin:) and k = 50
    With the n and and p Just started, Iâ€™ll definitely find it again. e In contrast, however, there is a problem in m3 is btc_check. The account must be a valid bitcoin address so I will create an address by This web (3EovkHLK5kkAbE8Kpe53mkEbyQGjyf8ECw)
    Now take the flag in accordance with the procedure above is finished
