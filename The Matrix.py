    I will first try to analyze the coding algorithm of the article. For

P = 2
N = 50
E = 31337

with N is the size of the matrix, in other words the matrix of the card is 50x50. The matrix will be placed in school. Fp with P = 2, almost identical to the results of XOR:

Trong F2 th√¨:
1 + 1 = 0
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1

    The encryption process is as follows. The first flag will be converted into a binary matrix mat. If the length of flag Not larger than the 50x50. mat will be cushioned to add the number 0, 1 random at the end. Then with a mess code. mat become the matrix of its own transposition.
